/* 
    Comparison Operators
    -JS does coercion when comparing values
        Coercion: process of converting one value type to another
 */

// Equal to ==

console.log("3" == 3);

/*Strict Equal to, ===
    checks to see if values match
*/

// Greater Than
3 > 2;

// Less Than
4 < 2;

/*  Greater than or equal to
    - greater than sign needs to come before the equal sign in order to work
 */

console.log(2 >= 2);

// And, &&
2 && 3;

// or, ||
2 || 3;
